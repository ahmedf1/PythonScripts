could do a similar approach as edfdump 
parse out the sections for each client and use machine learning to determine whether there was an error
	=> EX. For receivables
		pass in Volt's section
			classify on what type of error
				- No billed file
				- file has different chars that couldnt be parsed
				- no unbilled file
				- error with unbilled file etc
		then have a dashboard like the edfdump one but instead of the different sections,
			the categories will be the clients
		
MAIN ISSUE: NOT ENOUGH DATA
	- not many errors have occured as of late so don't really have failed examples to train algorithm on
	- only error has been discount error 
	- so do a error classification for each client



Finished log parsing
havent done ML yet
next step is to add choices
	|-> QA or PRD
	|-> Contracts or Receivables

having finished parsing for contracts should make parsing of Receivables easy
