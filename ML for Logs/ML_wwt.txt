Came up with two solutions to automate log checking


1. Machine learning based algorithm
	- reads the log file and based on its learned data makes a guess as to whether the file is a success or a failure and needs to be reviewed
	- idea is to cut out time of reading logs that are success
	- currently only way to determine this is through manually going thru the file
	- currently this approach is not always accurate due to the lack of an ample data set
	- current set contains only < 30 logs
	- need a lot more to be as accurate as possible
	- real issue is lacking in failure examples
							 
							 
2. Text Parsing of the Log Files			
	- maybe parse the log into its separate sections --> EDF Prices, M2M, Positions, etc
	- for each section analyze the amount of errors and then report the total to the google sheet
	- ties into making a gui for log reports
	


---Finished all this

-now the thing to consider is that the gui will only open on weekdays
-so when the holiday is during weekday I wont be there to see it and will have to open the txt file
to see if it was success or failure
-temp solution to this is set the task scheduler to open the process in parallel when there is 
already an instance running

ex) if holiday is on a tuesday, coming in on wednesday should show two instances of the gui,
	one for tuesday and one for wednesday
this is not the most efficient solution 

the most efficient solution would be to have a check to see whether today is a holiday
if it is then dont open the gui

then find the last non holiday business day and print all the status reports from that day to the ptd
